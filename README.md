## World_Population_Data_Analysis : 

## Problem Statement

Develop a Python project for world data analysis, sourcing information from online databases. The dataset comprises attributes such as country (or dependency), population (2023), yearly change, net change, population density (per square kilometer), land area (in square kilometers), net migrants, fertility rate, median age, urban population percentage, and world share. Utilize web scraping techniques to gather the latest data dynamically. Employ statistical and visual analysis methods to derive insights into global demographic trends, migration patterns, and urbanization rates. Present findings through interactive visualizations for stakeholders, aiding in informed decision-making for various sectors including public policy, economics, and urban planning.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Import Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping and requests for making HTTP requests.

- Step 2 : Collecting Data from Website: The script fetches data from a specified URL using requests library and parses it using BeautifulSoup.

- Step 3 : Finding Table Data: It identifies the table containing the required data from the HTML content.

- Step 4 : Collecting Table Headers: The headers of the table are extracted.

- Step 5 : Converting Table Headers to List: The headers are converted into a list for DataFrame column names.

- Step 6 : Importing Library for DataFrame: Pandas library is imported to create a DataFrame for storing the data.

- Step 7 : Collecting Column Data from Table: The script collects data from table rows and stores it in the DataFrame.

- Step 8 : Data Inspection: Various operations like checking information, shape, duplicates, null values, and data types of the DataFrame are performed.

- Step 9 : Data Manipulation: Operations such as replacing commas, converting data types, and calculating statistical measures like mean, median, and mode are executed.

- Step 10 : Visual Representation: Data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries with different types of plots including bar chart, pie chart, histogram, scatter plot, and correlation matrix heatmap.
